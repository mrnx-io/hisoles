# Facebook Ad Copy Orchestrator

Deploy 10+ conversion-optimizer droids in parallel to create the highest-performing Facebook video ad copy ever written.

---

## Mission

Generate **10/10 state-of-the-art Facebook ad copy** that stops the scroll, hooks instantly, and drives clicks to `/offer` with maximum purchase intent.

## Critical Requirements

1. **Every droid MUST start by invoking the `copywriting-master` skill** - Non-negotiable. The skill contains direct-response principles essential for paid social.

2. **Deploy exactly 10 conversion-optimizer droids in parallel** using the Task tool with `subagent_type: "conversion-optimizer"`

3. **Let the droids unleash their creativity** - Give them the angle, not the answer.

## Context

- **Product**: Hisoles comfort insoles ($39 single / $69 rotation bundle)
- **Format**: Facebook/Instagram video ads (trending vertical format)
- **Audience**: Cold traffic - people who stand all day at work
- **Landing page**: `/offer` (optimized for conversion)
- **Segments**: Healthcare, warehouse, construction, hospitality, retail

## Ad Copy Structure

Each ad needs:

- **Primary Text** (above the video) - The hook + story + CTA
- **Headline** (below the video) - The promise in <40 characters
- **Description** (optional) - Supporting proof or urgency

## The 10 Ad Angles

Launch one droid per angle. Each droid should:

- First invoke the `copywriting-master` skill
- Research the target segment's language and pain points
- Write 3-5 variations of complete ad copy
- Explain the psychology behind each hook

| #   | Angle                        | Target Emotion                             |
| --- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | **The Hour-6 Collapse**      | Pain recognition - "my feet are dying"     |
| 2   | **The Walk to the Car**      | End-of-shift dread visualization           |
| 3   | **I've Tried Everything**    | Skeptic conversion - why this is different |
| 4   | **The Concrete Problem**     | Hard floor specificity                     |
| 5   | **Two Pairs, Zero Excuses**  | Bundle value + rotation logic              |
| 6   | **The 90-Day Bet**           | Risk reversal as the hero                  |
| 7   | **What Nurses Know**         | Authority + segment targeting              |
| 8   | **Not Another Gel Insole**   | Differentiation from drugstore garbage     |
| 9   | **The Last Hours**           | Transformation - finishing strong          |
| 10  | **Your Feet After 12 Hours** | Before/after contrast                      |

## Hook Formula Requirements

Every primary text must:

- **Stop the scroll in <2 seconds** (pattern interrupt or pain call-out)
- **Create "that's me" recognition** within the first line
- **Build desire** through specificity and sensory language
- **Drive action** with clear, low-friction CTA

## After All Droids Complete

Synthesize outputs into:

1. **Top 10 ad variations** ranked by predicted CTR
2. **Headline bank** (20+ options organized by angle)
3. **Hook library** (first-line openers that stop the scroll)
4. **Segment-specific variations** (healthcare, warehouse, etc.)
5. **A/B testing matrix** with hypotheses

## Success Criteria

A nurse scrolling Instagram at 11pm after a 12-hour shift sees the ad and:

1. Stops scrolling immediately
2. Watches the video
3. Thinks "finally, someone gets it"
4. Clicks through ready to buy
