# Maximum Conversion Orchestrator

Deploy 10+ conversion-optimizer droids in parallel to achieve absolute landing page perfection.

---

## Mission

Transform `/offer` into a **10/10 state-of-the-art conversion masterpiece** for cold Facebook video ad traffic.

## Critical Requirements

1. **Every droid MUST start by invoking the `copywriting-master` skill** - This is non-negotiable. The skill contains the conversion copywriting principles that will guide all optimization decisions.

2. **Deploy exactly 10 conversion-optimizer droids in parallel** using the Task tool with `subagent_type: "conversion-optimizer"`

3. **Let the droids unleash their creativity** - Give them the mission, not the method. They know what to do.

## Context

- **Product**: Hisoles comfort insoles ($39 / $69 bundle)
- **Traffic**: 100% cold traffic from trending Facebook video ads
- **Target**: People who stand all day (healthcare, warehouse, construction, hospitality, retail)
- **Landing page**: `/src/app/offer/page.tsx` and all `/src/components/offer/*` components

## The 10 Conversion Levers

Launch one droid per lever. Each droid should:

- First invoke the `copywriting-master` skill
- Analyze the current state
- Propose specific, implementable improvements
- Output code changes ready to ship

| #   | Lever                     | Mission                                 |
| --- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Hero Domination**       | Make the first 3 seconds irresistible   |
| 2   | **Pricing Psychology**    | Make $69 feel like stealing             |
| 3   | **Social Proof**          | Build undeniable credibility            |
| 4   | **Objection Destruction** | Eliminate every reason NOT to buy       |
| 5   | **Mechanism Clarity**     | Make "why it works" instantly obvious   |
| 6   | **Mobile Friction**       | Remove every tap/scroll barrier         |
| 7   | **Emotional Copy**        | Make them FEEL the relief before buying |
| 8   | **Trust Architecture**    | Make buying feel completely safe        |
| 9   | **CTA Optimization**      | Make the action impossible to resist    |
| 10  | **Persona Targeting**     | Speak directly to each buyer type       |

## After All Droids Complete

Synthesize outputs into:

1. Priority-ranked implementation list
2. Component-by-component code changes
3. Quick wins that ship TODAY

## Success Criteria

Someone scrolling Facebook at 11pm after a brutal 12-hour shift sees the ad, lands on the page, and thinks: **"holy shit, I need this"** — then buys without hesitation.
