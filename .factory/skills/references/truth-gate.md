# Truth Gate

A protocol that prevents attention theft at the level where it most often happens:

**claims.**

This document is a constraint system.
It exists to make your copy defensible—before and after purchase.

---

## The Purpose

Copy fails ethically when:

- the reader is moved by what is not true, not supported, or not disclosed
- urgency exists only as a lever, not a reality
- authority is borrowed, implied, or inflated
- "results" are suggested without conditions

The Truth Gate makes those failures harder than honest writing.

## The Seven Truth Tests

Before a claim enters copy, run it through all seven:

1. **Specificity Test**
   What exactly is being claimed? (Remove ambiguity.)

2. **Evidence Test**
   What proof supports it? (Demo, data, mechanism, testimonial, credentials.)

3. **Worst‑Case Reader Test**
   What is the most optimistic interpretation a reader might take?
   Is that interpretation still true?

4. **Hostile‑But‑Fair Auditor Test**
   If a skeptic read this line aloud in court, could you defend it?

5. **Post‑Purchase Test**
   Would you still stand by the claim after they bought?
   Would you show them the evidence without embarrassment?

6. **Conditions Test**
   What must be true for the claim to hold?
   Are those conditions disclosed (or obvious) to the reader?

7. **Consent Test**
   Does withholding any detail here change informed choice?
   If yes, disclose.

If any test fails: revise, narrow, qualify, or delete.

## Claim Types and Requirements

### 1) Outcome claims ("You will get X")

**Risk:** implied guarantee; creates false certainty
**Allowed forms:**

- "Designed to help you…"
- "Most useful if you…"
- "If you do X, you can reasonably expect Y movement…" (only with evidence + conditions)

**Required:** conditions + honest effort/time/capability framing

---

### 2) Time claims ("in 7 days", "fast")

**Risk:** most abused claim category
**Allowed forms:**

- "You can complete the first step in 30 minutes." (if true)
- "Many people notice early wins quickly." (if you can support what "early wins" means)
- "Timeline depends on…" (then name dependencies)

**Required:** what "fast" means + what variables change it

---

### 3) Comparative claims ("best", "#1", "better than")

**Risk:** vague superiority; legal/credibility exposure
**Allowed forms:**

- "Different in these three ways…" (list verifiable differences)
- "Built for [specific constraint] where most options assume [other constraint]…"
- "If you care about X, you may prefer this because…"

**Required:** comparison criteria + scope
**Avoid:** absolute superlatives unless you can prove them.

---

### 4) Scarcity claims ("only 20 spots")

**Risk:** manufactured scarcity
**Allowed forms (only when true):**

- capacity limits (service hours, cohort size, inventory)
- time limits tied to real events (launch window, legal cutoff, seasonal availability)
- bonus limits tied to real cost (printing, fulfillment, live support)

**Required:**

- the **Reason Why** scarcity exists
- what happens after it's gone (waitlist? later cohort? price changes?)
- no fake countdowns

---

### 5) Urgency claims ("ends tonight", "act now")

**Risk:** coercion by clock
**Allowed forms (only when true):**

- real deadlines
- real consequences of delay (missed cohort, next shipment, price increase you will actually enforce)

**Required:** concrete date/time + reason why
**If not true:** do not use urgency. Period.

---

### 6) Authority claims ("experts say", "proven", "clinically")

**Risk:** implied credentials or studies
**Allowed forms:**

- name your real credentials (without inflation)
- explain the mechanism simply
- use "we tested internally" only if you can show what that means

**Required:** verifiable source or remove the claim
**Avoid:** vague "science says" language.

---

### 7) Testimonials and social proof

**Risk:** cherry‑picking and implied typicality
**Allowed forms:**

- "Here's one customer's experience…"
- "Results vary; here's what happened for them and what they did."

**Required:** context:

- who they are (relevant traits)
- what they did
- what timeframe
- what constraints

If you can't provide context, soften the testimonial.

---

### 8) Guarantees

**Risk:** hidden terms; bait-and-switch
**Allowed forms:**

- clear, simple terms
- low‑friction process
- time window you will honor

**Required:**

- exactly what triggers the guarantee
- exactly what the customer must do (if anything)
- exactly how to claim it

If your guarantee requires fine print to survive, rewrite it.

---

## The Proof Ladder

Use the strongest proof you can honestly provide:

1. **Direct demonstration** — show the thing working
2. **Mechanism** — explain why it works (and when it won't)
3. **Documentation** — screenshots, logs, before/after with conditions
4. **Third‑party validation** — credible, relevant, verifiable
5. **Testimonials** — contextualized and non‑typicality implied
6. **Authority cues** — only as support, never as substitute

---

## Truth Gate Language Patterns (safe defaults)

Use these as "integrity‑preserving phrasing":

- "Designed to help you…"
- "Most effective when…"
- "If you're the kind of person who…"
- "Here's what it does / does not do…"
- "Here's what it costs (time/effort)…"
- "If you don't want that cost, don't buy."

These patterns protect agency and reduce refund regret.

---

## Regulated Domains (fast guardrails)

If you're anywhere near **health, finance, legal, safety, children**, be extra strict:

- avoid diagnosis/treatment claims without proper authority
- avoid "guaranteed income," "risk‑free investment," "cure," "clinically proven" without documentation
- disclose risks and dependencies plainly
- prefer education and decision support over outcome promises

When uncertain: narrow claims, add conditions, remove absolutes.

## The Truth Gate Output

When the gate passes, you should be able to write, in one line:

**"This copy is persuasive because it is true, clear, and respectful of choice."**
