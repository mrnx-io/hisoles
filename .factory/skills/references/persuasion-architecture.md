# Persuasion Architecture

Complete reference for Rule of One, awareness levels, sophistication stages, and lead archetypes.

All elements derive from the axiom: **Attention is sacred. Every demand on consciousness must be earned.**

---

## Rule of One

**Axiom**: Persuasion requires singular focus. Multiple benefits dilute; one benefit pierces.

### 5 Aligned Components

| Component                   | Definition                          | Test                                  |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **One Good Idea**           | Grasp instantly, unique, jolting    | Can reader repeat it in one sentence? |
| **One Core Emotion**        | The LF8 driver (biological urgency) | Does it tap primal desire?            |
| **One Captivating Story**   | Validates the promise               | Does story prove the idea works?      |
| **One Desirable Benefit**   | The dream outcome                   | Is it what they actually want?        |
| **One Inevitable Response** | Clear, singular CTA                 | Is there only one action to take?     |

### Golden Thread

All 5 components must align to the same emotional core:

```
Idea → Emotion → Story → Benefit → Response
  ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓          ↓
  All connected by One Emotion (LF8)
```

### Tossed Salad Problem

Bad copy throws multiple benefits hoping one sticks:

- "Save time AND money AND hassle AND..."
- Result: B-level copy, diluted impact

Good copy pierces with one:

- "Never miss your child's soccer game again"
- Result: Emotional resonance, action

**Derivation**: Earned Entry — multiple benefits demand attention for each; one benefit earns attention once and repays it fully.

## Schwartz 5 Awareness Levels

**Axiom**: Strategy = Prospect's Reality. Headlines must enter the ongoing conversation in their mind.

### Level Definitions

| Level                 | State             | What They Know                      | Your Strategy                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Most Aware**     | Ready to buy      | Product, price, benefits            | Direct offer, compelling reason to act NOW |
| **2. Product-Aware**  | Comparing options | Product exists, unsure if best      | Sharpen desire, demonstrate superiority    |
| **3. Solution-Aware** | Seeking solution  | Result needed, not specific product | Name desire + connect to your solution     |
| **4. Problem-Aware**  | Feeling pain      | Problem exists, no solution in mind | Agitate pain + present as the answer       |
| **5. Unaware**        | No idea           | Neither problem nor solution        | Indirect identification, story entry       |

### Strategy by Level

**Most Aware** — Go direct:

- "50% off [Product] — Today Only" (only if true)
- Strong CTA, price justification

**Product-Aware** — Differentiate:

- "Why [Product] Works Differently"
- Unique mechanism, proof

**Solution-Aware** — Bridge:

- "The Fastest Way to [Result]"
- Connect their goal to your method

**Problem-Aware** — Agitate then solve:

- "Tired of [Pain]? Here's What's Actually Happening"
- Feel the pain, offer relief

**Unaware** — Identify:

- "They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano..."
- Story-based entry, no mention of product

## 5 Sophistication Stages

Market evolves; strategy must adapt.

### Stage Progression

| Stage   | Market State        | Strategy            | Example                                |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **1st** | Unsophisticated     | Direct claim        | "I'd Walk a Mile for a Camel"          |
| **2nd** | Claims copied       | Enlarge the claim   | "Light Up a Lucky...Won't Miss Sweets" |
| **3rd** | Skeptical of claims | New mechanism       | "They're Toasted!" (how, not what)     |
| **4th** | Mechanisms copied   | Elaborate mechanism | "20,000 Filter Traps"                  |
| **5th** | Exhausted market    | Identification      | Marlboro Man (identity, not product)   |

### Shift Pattern

```
Stage 1-2: WHAT it does (claims)
     ↓
Stage 3-4: HOW it works (mechanism)
     ↓
Stage 5: WHO you become (identity)
```

### Detecting Your Market's Stage

- **Stage 1-2**: Competitors make simple claims, market responds
- **Stage 3-4**: Competitors explain mechanisms, claim fatigue
- **Stage 5**: No claim works, identity/lifestyle positioning wins

## 6 Lead Archetypes

**Axiom**: Lead = Emotional Gatekeeper. 80% impact in first 20% (Pareto).

**Sequence**: Emotional preference → Logical rationalization

### Directness Spectrum

| Lead                 | Approach          | Awareness Fit          |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Offer**            | Direct            | Most Aware             |
| **Promise**          | Direct            | Product/Solution Aware |
| **Problem-Solution** | Moderate Indirect | Solution/Problem Aware |
| **Secret**           | Indirect          | Problem/Unaware        |
| **Proclamation**     | Strong Indirect   | Unaware                |
| **Story**            | High Indirect     | Skeptical/Unaware      |

---

### 1. Offer Lead (Direct)

**Best for**: Most Aware prospects ready to buy

**4 Rules**:

1. Open with compelling detail
2. State value benefit immediately
3. Elaborate on specifics
4. Give reason why (justification)

**Example** (The Economist):

> "May I send you 3 FREE Issues of The Economist? Over 2.5 million educated professionals trust The Economist for global insight..."

**Derivation**: Earned Entry — Most Aware readers want efficiency; offer lead respects their time by going direct.

---

### 2. Promise Lead (Direct)

**Best for**: Product/Solution Aware prospects evaluating options

**Formula (Reeves USP)**:

- **Specific**: Exact benefit
- **Unique**: Only you offer it
- **Mass-appeal**: Wide desire

**Example** (Carnegie):

> "How to Win Friends and Influence People"

**Derivation**: Living Materials — USP based on eternal desires (social approval, superiority) ages well.

---

### 3. Problem-Solution Lead (Moderate Indirect)

**Best for**: Solution/Problem Aware prospects feeling pain

**Sub-types**:

- **If-Then**: "If you struggle with X, then..."
- **Inversion**: "What if X wasn't the problem?"
- **ID**: "Are you a [type] who..."
- **Question**: "Do you ever feel..."
- **Instruction**: "Stop doing X. Start doing Y."

**Example** (Sackheim):

> "Do You Make These Mistakes in English?"

**Derivation**: Sacred Friction — the question creates self-identification; friction grounds commitment.

---

### 4. Secret Lead (Indirect)

**Best for**: Problem/Unaware prospects needing curiosity hook

**4 Rules**:

1. Open with intriguing benefit
2. Introduce via headline
3. Escalate clues throughout
4. **Pay back the loop** (mystery-integrity.md)

**Techniques**:

- **Neologizing**: Invent new term for known concept
- **Transubstantiation**: Rename commodity as discovery
- **Velvet Pouch**: Tease benefits without reveal — but disclose terms before CTA

**Example**:

> "The Royalty Program: How ordinary investors collect 'royalty checks' every month..."

**Integrity check**: The "secret" is dividends renamed. Must disclose this is dividend investing before asking for purchase.

**Derivation**: Pregnant Void — what's withheld creates curiosity; what's disclosed protects consent.

---

### 5. Proclamation Lead (Strong Indirect)

**Best for**: Unaware prospects needing pattern interrupt

**4 Rules**:

1. Make bold, surprising statement
2. Imply strong promise
3. Keep relevant to offer
4. Close with return to claim

**Example**:

> "Most people spend more time planning vacations than planning their retirement. That's why they end up broke."

**Note**: Proclamation must stay grounded. Avoid fear-shock or doom-mongering. Preserve agency.

**Derivation**: Threshold — proclamation is a threshold moment; it must honor the crossing rather than coerce it.

---

### 6. Story Lead (High Indirect)

**Best for**: Skeptical/Unaware prospects with resistance

**Elements**:

- Narrative immersion
- Golden thread (emotion tie throughout)
- Unresolved hook → paid back with meaning
- TPM (Transformational Philosophical Message)

**Example** (Wall Street Journal):

> "On a beautiful late spring afternoon, twenty-five years ago, two young men graduated from the same college. They were very much alike..."

**Derivation**: Living Materials — story structures are narratively eternal; they compound rather than fade.
