# Marketing Systems

Complete reference for direct response fundamentals, offer architecture, and funnel systems.

All elements derive from the axiom: **Attention is sacred. Every demand on consciousness must be earned.**

## 10 Direct Response Rules

Every dollar must return ≥2×. Math over magic.

### Rule 1: Always an Offer

Every piece must have a measurable offer:

- **Lead-gen**: Free info, consultation, audit
- **Direct**: Purchase, trial, signup
- **Hybrid**: Multiple offers (info kit + trial)

Threshold spectrum: Low (info kit) → High (free exam)

### Rule 2: Reason to Respond Now

**Only when true.** If urgency is manufactured, it fails the Truth Gate.

**Real urgency**:

- **True scarcity**: Limited capacity, inventory constraints
- **Real deadline**: Cohort closes, legal cutoff, seasonal window
- **Genuine consequence**: Missed opportunity, compounding cost

**Not urgency**:

- Countdown timers that reset
- "Limited time" that isn't limited
- "Only X left" when X is infinite

If you cannot enforce it, do not say it.

### Rule 3: Clear Instructions

Explicit CTA: "Click This Button Now"

Disney principle: Eliminate confusion to increase satisfaction.

### Rule 4: Track/Measure/Account

- **Target**: LTV:CAC ≥ 3:1
- **Deeper**: Ad #2 may win on LTV even if worse on immediate response
- **Tools**: Unique codes, surveys, pixel tracking

### Rule 5: No-Cost Brand-Building

Blind ads suppress response. Brand = byproduct of direct response. Un-brand for curiosity when needed.

### Rule 6: Follow-Up

The 5 "holes" where leads leak:

1. Unknown callers (who inquired?)
2. Trade shows (collected cards, never contacted)
3. Referrals (mentioned but not followed)
4. New customers (no onboarding sequence)
5. Lost clients (no reactivation)

Sequence: Re-state offer → Reminder → Final → Change offer

### Rule 7: Strong Copy

Emotional/conversational, facts from customer psyche.

**Avoid 6 defaults**: Company focus, feature lists, jargon, passive voice, weak verbs, no story.

Mantra: "Clear beats clever."

### Rule 8: Proven Formats

Proven formats that sell:

- **Pictorial**: Image-heavy, aspirational
- **Advertorial**: Editorial approach (disclose clearly)
- **Letter**: Personal, direct address

### Rule 9: Results Rule

- Test controls (split: headline/offer)
- Embrace "weird" (ugly > beautiful if +sales)
- Math over new fads

### Rule 10: Discipline

Purge junk, plan rules, track metrics, build muscle, avoid hazards.

## Value Ladder Architecture

Ascending commitment: low-risk entry → high-value loyalty.

```
Bait (Free/Low) → Frontend ($27-97) → Middle ($97-2k) → Backend (High-Ticket) → Continuity (Recurring)
     ↓                   ↓                  ↓                    ↓                    ↓
  Info Kit          Core Product      Webinar/Upsell      Application/Call        Subscription
Low Threshold      First Purchase      Monetization          Ascension           Stable Revenue
```

**Derivation**: Sacred Friction — each step requires commitment; smoothness creates churn.

### Example: Dentist

- **Bait**: Free cleaning
- **Frontend**: Whitening ($200)
- **Middle**: Invisalign ($3,000)
- **Backend**: Implants ($15,000)
- **Continuity**: Bi-annual cleanings ($150/yr)

### Example: Course Creator

- **Bait**: Free PDF guide
- **Frontend**: $27 mini-course
- **Middle**: $497 main course
- **Backend**: $5,000 coaching
- **Continuity**: $97/mo membership

## 4 Money Model Offer Types

### 1. Attraction Offers (Acquire Leads)

High-value proposition to enter funnel:

| Play               | Mechanism                                  | Example                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |

| **Giveaways**      | Partial scholarship/discount               | "50% scholarship for first 20" (if true)   |
| **Decoy**          | Premium contrast makes standard attractive | $2000 / $500 / $200 options                |
| **BOGO**           | Perceived value > discount                 | "Buy 1, Get 1 Free"                        |
| **Pay Less Now**   | Frictionless trial                         | "$1 for first month" (disclose full price) |

### 2. Upsell Offers (Increase Transaction)

Next logical problem:

| Play         | Mechanism            | Example                           |
| ------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |

| **Menu**     | Choice architecture  | "Would you like fries with that?" |
| **Anchor**   | High-price first     | Show $10k first, then $2k         |
| **Rollover** | Credit prior payment | "Your $97 applies to upgrade"     |

### 3. Downsell Offers (Salvage Declines)

Change offer, not price:

| Process               | Mechanism            | Example                                   |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Payment Plans**     | Spread cost          | "3 payments of $333"                      |
| **Trial with Terms**  | Engagement incentive | "$1 trial, cancel anytime" (disclose how) |
| **Feature Downsells** | Value negotiation    | "Just the course, no coaching"            |

### 4. Continuity Offers (Maximize LTV)

Ongoing value for recurring:

| Play                 | Mechanism                  | Example                                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Continuity Bonus** | Free item for signup       | "Join and get $500 toolkit free"            |
| **Discount**         | Free period for commitment | "First 2 months free with annual"           |
| **Waived Fee**       | Setup waiver               | "No setup fee if you start today" (if true) |

## Grand Slam Offer Construction

### Value Equation

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

**Maximize numerator** (honestly):

- **Dream Outcome**: Ultimate transformation ("Retire comfortably" > "Investment course")
- **Likelihood**: Proof, guarantees, testimonials, case studies — all verifiable

**Minimize denominator** (truthfully):

- **Time Delay**: Speed to result ("Results often visible within 30 days")
- **Effort**: Done-for-you ("We handle the technical setup")

### Phase 1: Problems & Solutions

1. Define the Dream Outcome (transformation over commodity)
2. List all problems (before/during/after pains)
3. Convert each problem to addressable solution

### Phase 2: Trim & Stack

1. Brainstorm delivery vehicles (1:1, group, virtual, physical)
2. Apply criteria: High value / Low cost
3. Bundle into unique deliverable (incomparable)

### 5 Psychological Enhancers

| Enhancer       | Target | Implementation                                | Integrity Check             |
| -------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Scarcity**   | Delay  | Limited capacity                              | Only if real constraint     |
| **Urgency**    | Delay  | Cohort closes, price rises                    | Only if enforced            |
| **Bonuses**    | Dream  | Tools/checklists > more training              | Must add real value         |
| **Guarantees** | Effort | Unconditional/conditional                     | Must honor without friction |
| **Naming**     | All    | Reason Why + Avatar + Goal + Time + Container | Must match reality          |

**Truth Gate check**: Before using any enhancer, verify it passes all 7 tests in `truth-gate.md`.

**Naming Formula**: "[Adjective] [Avatar] [Goal] in [Timeframe] [Container]"

- Example: "Clarity Copywriting System: 30-Day Intensive"

## Attractive Character (AC)

Persona engine for relational bond.

### 4 Elements

1. **Backstory** — Journey from similar situation (achievability)
2. **Parables** — Stories that teach concepts (memorable)
3. **Flaws** — Human vulnerabilities (relatability)
4. **Polarity** — Strong opinions (attract fans, repel others)

### 4 Archetypes

| Archetype          | Style              | Example                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Leader**         | Guide the path     | "Follow me, I've been there"               |

| **Reporter**       | Expert interviews  | "I asked 100 practitioners..."             |
| **Reluctant Hero** | Duty-bound sharing | "I didn't plan to share this, but..."      |

### 6 Storylines

1. **Loss/Redemption** — Fell from grace, climbed back
2. **Us vs. Them** — Common enemy bonding
3. **Before/After** — Transformation journey
4. **Amazing Discovery** — Stumbled upon insight
5. **Secret Telling** — Insider knowledge revealed (pay back the loop)
6. **Third-Person Testimonial** — Someone else's transformation

## Email Sequences

### Soap Opera Sequence (5 emails for bonding)

| Email | Purpose         | Content                               |
| ----- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Set the stage   | Introduce conflict, open loop         |
| 2     | High drama      | Backstory climax, tension peak        |
| 3     | Epiphany        | Discovery moment, solution appears    |
| 4     | Hidden benefits | Transformation proof, unexpected wins |
| 5     | Close + CTA     | Close the loop, clear next step       |

**Integrity note**: Urgency in email 5 only if real. "The decision is yours" returns agency.

### Daily Seinfeld (ongoing)

- 90% value / 10% offer mention
