# Derivation Atlas

A map that forces integration:

**Every lever must pay its cost.**

Use this when designing, drafting, and rewriting.
If you can't place a lever in this map, it's probably arbitrary—or unethical.

## How to Use

For each persuasion element you plan to use:

1. Name it.
2. Identify which Law it serves.
3. State the attention debt it repays.
4. Name its failure mode (how it becomes theft).
5. Run the verification test.
6. Use the minimal ethical form.

## The Integration Check

When you finish a piece, you should be able to answer:

- Which 1–3 levers did I use most?
- Which Laws did they serve?
- What attention debt did they repay?
- Where could a reader feel coerced or misled?
- What did I do to protect agency?

If you can't answer, rewrite.
