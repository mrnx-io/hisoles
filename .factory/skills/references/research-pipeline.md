# Research Pipeline

Great copy is not written.

It is **extracted**.

From language the market already uses.
From fears and desires already alive.
From constraints already real.
From proof already earned.

This pipeline produces the inputs that make truthful persuasion easy.

---

## Outputs (what you must produce before writing)

1. **Voice‑of‑Customer Bank (VoC)**
   50–200 raw quotes, grouped by theme.

2. **Dream Outcome Map**
   What "better" looks like in the customer's words.

3. **Objection Matrix**
   Every reason not to buy, categorized, with the real fear underneath.

4. **Proof Inventory**
   Each claim you might make mapped to the proof you can show.

5. **Mechanism Statement**
   One sentence explaining why your approach works (and when it won't).

6. **Fit Filters**
   Who it's for / not for, prerequisites, and honest costs.

If you do not have these, your copy will drift toward invention.

## Step 1: Define the Job (not the persona)

Answer:

- What is the customer trying to **accomplish**?
- What makes it hard **right now**?
- What does "success" look like **in their life**, not in your feature list?
- What are the constraints (time, money, energy, identity, risk tolerance)?

Write it as a sentence:

> "They are trying to **_ while avoiding _** and still maintaining \_\_\_."

---

## Step 2: Collect raw language (VoC)

Best sources (choose what you actually have):

- support tickets / chat logs
- sales call notes
- onboarding forms
- post‑purchase surveys
- cancellation reasons
- customer interviews
- reviews (yours and competitors)
- community posts (your audience's spaces)

Rules:

- collect **verbatim**
- keep context (who said it, when, situation)
- do not "clean up" grammar (the mess is the gold)

---

## Step 3: Extract and label

Create tags:

- **PAIN** (what hurts)
- **FEAR** (what they're afraid will happen)
- **DESIRE** (what they want)
- **OBJECTION** (why they won't buy)
- **TRIGGER** (what makes them act)
- **LANGUAGE** (phrases they repeat)
- **IDENTITY** ("I'm not the kind of person who…")

Then cluster themes.

You're looking for **repeated sentences**, not clever insights.

---

## Step 4: Build the Objection Matrix

Columns:

- objection (verbatim)
- the fear underneath
- what proof would dissolve it
- what constraint must be disclosed
- the honest answer (sometimes: "you're right; this isn't for you")

Example structure:

| Objection            | Underneath fear             | Proof needed         | Constraint          | Honest answer                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| "I don't have time." | "I'll fail and feel worse." | quick early win demo | requires 20 min/day | "If you can't do 20 min/day, don't buy." |

This is Sacred Friction in written form.

---

## Step 5: Build the Proof Inventory

For each claim you want to make, list:

- claim (tight, testable)
- proof available
- proof missing
- safest truthful phrasing

Example:

| Claim                   | Proof available            | Missing | Safe phrasing                                                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Set up in 15 minutes." | internal timed walkthrough | none    | "Most people can complete setup in ~15 minutes if they already have X." |

The Truth Gate lives here.

---

## Step 6: Derive the Mechanism Statement

One sentence:

> "It works because **_, which means _**, as long as \_\_\_."

Mechanism is what makes claims believable without hype.

---

## Step 7: Translate into copy inputs

From the above, produce:

- top 3 pains (verbatim)
- top 3 desires (verbatim)
- top 3 objections + proof counters
- one mechanism sentence
- one "Reason Why now" (only if true)
- one fit filter ("not for you if…")

Now write.

## The Research Integrity Rule

If you can't find it in VoC or proof,
you don't get to imply it in copy.

You can still be persuasive.

You just have to be real.
