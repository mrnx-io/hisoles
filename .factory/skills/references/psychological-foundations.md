# Psychological Foundations

Complete reference for psychological frameworks underlying persuasive communication.

All elements derive from the axiom: **Attention is sacred. Every demand on consciousness must be earned.**

## Life-Force 8 (LF8): Core Human Motivators

Eight biologically programmed desires present in all humans, driving the majority of decisions. LF8 operates continuously and trumps secondary wants.

**Mechanism**: Tension (unmet need) → Desire → Action (to resolve)

### Complete LF8 Catalog

| #   | Desire                              | Definition                                                  | Marketing Application                         |
| --- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Survival, life extension**        | Innate drive to live longer, avoid death, maximize vitality | Anti-aging, health insurance, safety products |
| 2   | **Food/beverage enjoyment**         | Sensory pleasure from eating/drinking; comfort and reward   | Vivid imagery: "steaming hot fudge"           |
| 3   | **Freedom from fear, pain, danger** | Avoidance of threats; relief from discomfort                | Security systems, pain relief                 |
| 4   | **Sexual companionship**            | Drive for mating, attraction, intimacy                      | Perfume, dating, attraction products          |

### Historical Evidence

Haldeman-Julius (1920s-1930s mail-order bookseller) tested LF8 via title changes:

- Titles aligned with LF8 drivers consistently outperformed
- **Key insight**: Title is proxy for headline — test LF8 alignment first

**Derivation**: Living Materials — LF8 desires are biologically eternal; copy built on them ages well.

## Nine Secondary (Learned) Wants

Socially conditioned desires for rational justification. Always subordinate to LF8.

1. **To be informed** — Desire for knowledge ("Insider insights")
2. **Curiosity** — Drive to explore unknowns
3. **Cleanliness** — Hygiene, orderliness
4. **Efficiency** — Time-saving, streamlined
5. **Convenience** — Ease of access
6. **Dependability/quality** — Reliability
7. **Beauty/style** — Aesthetic appeal
8. **Economy/profit** — Cost savings, ROI
9. **Bargains** — Perceived value

**Application**: Use Secondary Wants for WIIFM (What's In It For Me?) justification after LF8 hook.

## Cognitive Biases & Heuristics

Mental shortcuts that influence decisions. Use ethically — to clarify, not to confuse.

### Key Principles

| Principle                  | Definition                                       | Ethical Application                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Transfer**               | Borrow credibility from authority/symbols        | Only if authority is real and relevant        |
| **Social Proof**           | "Others doing it" guides decisions               | Only with authentic testimonials with context |
| **Means-End Chain**        | Focus on ultimate benefit, not feature           | Connect feature to real outcome               |
| **Inoculation**            | Present weak attack to strengthen defense        | Honestly address competitor strengths         |
| **ELM**                    | Dual paths: Central (logic) vs Peripheral (cues) | Match approach to stake level                 |
| **Examples vs Statistics** | Stories > data for emotion                       | True stories with honest outcomes             |
| **Message Sidedness**      | Acknowledge rival → refute                       | Fair-minded credibility                       |
| **Repetition**             | Build familiarity/trust                          | Repeat truth, not manufactured claims         |
| **Evidence**               | Third-party validation                           | Verifiable sources only                       |

### Cialdini's 6 Principles (Ethical Use)

1. **Reciprocation** — Give genuine value first (no implied debt)
2. **Commitment** — Small honest ask before big ask
3. **Social Proof** — Real testimonials with context
4. **Liking** — Authentic connection
5. **Authority** — Real credentials, relevant expertise
6. **Scarcity** — Only when true constraint exists

**Derivation**: Each principle traces to Earned Entry — the tactic must earn its effect honestly.

## Authentic Influence Mindset

3-part framework for genuine influence in copy and positioning.

### Components

1. **Conviction** — Unshakable belief in mission
   - Effect: Natural confidence (feigned conviction fails)
   - Application: "I KNOW this works" → authentic power in copy

2. **Concern** — Total attention on reader's needs
   - Effect: Reader feels genuinely understood
   - Application: Research deeply, reflect accurately

3. **Focus** — Undeterred by approval-seeking
   - Effect: Confidence signals value
   - Application: Write for fit, not for everyone

### Reframing Outcomes

Redefine success broadly:

1. Acknowledge limits (can't persuade all — nor should you)
2. Frame all outcomes as learning (rejection = intelligence gained)
3. Assign meaning constructively (you control interpretation)

## 9 Needs-Based Framework

Emotional drivers that create bonds stronger than logic.

| Need                | Definition                         | Ethical Copy Application                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Validation/Hope** | Encourage dreams at impasse        | "Your instincts were right all along" (only if true) |
| **Relief**          | Externalize failures appropriately | "The approach was wrong, not you" (when accurate)    |
| **Security**        | Allay fears                        | Evidence until fears subside                         |
| **Confirmation**    | Affirm accurate suspicions         | "You suspected this for years" (based on research)   |
| **Camaraderie**     | Common challenge bonding           | "We're solving this together"                        |
| **Significance**    | Feel needed/unique                 | Genuine role in the community                        |
| **Agency**          | Preserve choice                    | "The decision is yours" (design constraint)          |
| **Insight**         | Valuable knowledge                 | Real information worth knowing                       |
| **Certainty**       | Need to be right                   | Validate accurate beliefs, gently correct false ones |

**Derivation**: Threshold — each need addressed must honor the reader's agency and crossing.

---

## Psychological Ventriloquism

Induce self-generated conclusions rather than stating claims directly.

**Method**: Create situations → reader concludes belief as their own

**Examples**:

- Technical details convey expertise without claiming it
- Story arc leads to insight reader discovers
- Demonstration shows rather than tells

**Integrity check**: The conclusion must be true. Ventriloquism for false beliefs is manipulation.

**Derivation**: Pregnant Void — what's unsaid creates space for the reader to arrive at truth.

---

## CMAD Process: 5-Step Contextual Architecture

Design belief through context.

1. **Define Proposal** — What need satisfied (LF8)? What awareness stage? Success metric?
2. **Explore Context** — Pre-beliefs, hidden drivers, reception state
3. **Message Components** — 2-3 themes; choose mechanics
4. **Indirect Conveyance** — Stories/demos (show, don't tell)
5. **Measure** — Test small-scale; iterate

---

## Application Protocol

When writing copy:

1. Identify primary LF8 driver (biological urgency)
2. Select supporting Secondary Want (rational justification)
3. Choose 2-3 cognitive principles for the piece
4. Adopt authentic influence stance in voice
5. Address 2-3 Needs from framework
6. Apply ventriloquism: show, don't tell (truthfully)
7. Use CMAD to architect the context
8. Pass every element through Truth Gate

## The Integrity Boundary

Psychology is a tool. Tools can harm.

**We use psychological principles to:**

- Clarify genuine value
- Connect real benefits to real desires
- Help readers understand their own needs
- Remove friction from good decisions

**We do not use psychological principles to:**

- Create false beliefs
- Manufacture urgency or fear
- Exploit vulnerabilities
- Override informed consent

The line is consent: Does the reader, fully informed, still want what we're offering?

If the answer requires deception to be "yes," the offer fails.

| ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| LF8 Drivers      | Living Materials | Eternal desires age well                |
| Secondary Wants  | Earned Entry     | Justification earns rational acceptance |
| Cognitive Biases | Earned Entry     | Used to clarify, not confuse            |
| Cialdini's 6     | Sacred Friction  | Real friction grounds commitment        |
| Needs Framework  | Threshold        | Each need honored at the crossing       |
