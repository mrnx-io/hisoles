# Copywriting Systems

Complete reference for Kennedy 28-Step, Sugarman 23 Elements, Hypnotic Writing, and tactical formulas.

All elements derive from the axiom: **Attention is sacred. Every demand on consciousness must be earned.**

## Kennedy 28-Step Sales Letter System

**Axiom**: Preparation > Writing (80% upfront). Multi-step sequences outperform single shots.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Steps 1-5)

#### Step 1: Get Into the Customer

**10 Questions to Answer**:

1. What keeps them awake at night?
2. What are they afraid of?
3. What are they angry about? Who are they angry at?
4. What are their top 3 daily frustrations?
5. What trends affect their lives?
6. What do they secretly desire most?
7. What biases do they bring to decisions?
8. Who else sells to them? How?
9. Who are their heroes and enemies?
10. What language do they use?

**Theater Exercise**: Visualize receiving the letter. What would make YOU read it?

See: `research-pipeline.md` for VoC extraction methodology.

#### Step 2: Get Into the Offer

**Transform Features → Benefits**:

- Feature: 8GB RAM
- Benefit: Run multiple programs without slowdown
- Hidden Benefit: Never lose work to crashes again

Find the hidden benefit behind the benefit.

#### Step 3: Create Damaging Admission

Acknowledge flaws to build credibility.

**Example** (Italian restaurant):

> "We don't have tuxedo-clad waiters or fancy décor. What we do have is your grandmother's recipes, made fresh every morning."

**Formula**: Admit weakness → Pivot to strength → Turn liability into asset

**Derivation**: Living Materials — honest admissions age with dignity; manufactured flaws fail the Truth Gate.

#### Step 4: Think About Delivery

- First-class stamps over bulk
- Live stamps, not meter
- Personal envelope appearance
- Handwriting elements when possible

#### Step 5: Get It Opened

Personal envelope appearance. Promise on outside = promise inside.

**Warning**: Mismatch between envelope promise and content destroys trust permanently.

### Phase 2: Persuasion (Steps 6-14)

#### Step 6: Get It Read

**12 Headline Formulas**:

| #   | Formula                                                | Example                                                                    |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | "Who Else Wants [Benefit]?"                            | "Who Else Wants to Retire 10 Years Early?"                                 |

**Truth Gate check**: Every headline must pass the 7 tests. "Warning" headlines must warn about real, verifiable risks.

#### Step 7: Beat the Price Bugaboo

**5 Price Strategies**:

| Strategy             | Mechanism                | Example                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Apples-Oranges**   | Incomparable positioning | "Not a course—a transformation system"        |
| **Bulk**             | Per-unit reduction       | "$997 for 12 months = $2.73/day"              |
| **Development Cost** | R&D justification        | "After 10 years of testing..."                |
| **Parts > Whole**    | Component stacking       | "Module 1 alone addresses [specific problem]" |
| **Clarity First**    | Total price visible      | Total price first, breakdown second           |

**3 Letter Formulas**:

1. **Problem-Agitation-Solution** (PAS): State problem → Deepen understanding → Offer relief
2. **Fortune Telling**: Project future with/without solution (honestly)
3. **Contrast**: Two paths, different outcomes

#### Step 8: Review Techniques

| Technique         | Mechanism           | Application                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Qualification** | Filter for fit      | "Only for serious applicants"                         |
| **Credibility**   | Verifiable facts    | "Verified by 3rd party audit"                         |
| **ROI**           | Value demonstration | "Typical return for clients who complete the program" |
| **Quality**       | Premium positioning | "For those who value precision"                       |
| **Guarantee**     | Risk reversal       | 5 types below                                         |

**5 Guarantee Types**:

1. **Basic**: Money back, no questions
2. **Keep Premium**: Refund but keep bonus
3. **Redundancy**: Double guarantee
4. **Trial**: Use then decide
5. **Focus**: Guarantee specific outcome (only if you can deliver)

#### Step 9: First Draft

Write freely. No editing. Get it out.

#### Step 10: Strategic Rewrite

- **Double Path**: Impulsive skim vs. analytical deep read
- **Repetition**: 6 methods (direct, varied, examples, visuals, testimonials, summary)
- **Yes-Sequence**: Series of agreements leading to purchase
- **Page Teasers**: Mid-sentence page breaks → force turn

#### Step 11: Style Rewrite

- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Short sentences (vary rhythm)
- First paragraph = extended headline
- Entertaining, sensory, vivid words
- Personal voice ("I" and "you")

#### Step 12: Address Objections

**Proactive objection handling**:

1. List every reason NOT to buy
2. FAQ with answer + testimonial + guarantee for each
3. Raise objections BEFORE reader thinks them

See: `research-pipeline.md` for Objection Matrix methodology.

#### Step 13: Honest Reasons to Act

**Real reasons to act now** (only when true):

| Reason               | When Valid             | Example                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Limited Capacity** | Real constraint        | "I work with 12 clients per quarter"   |
| **Bonus Expiration** | Enforced deadline      | "Bonuses end when cohort closes"       |
| **Price Change**     | Scheduled increase     | "Price rises January 1"                |
| **Seasonal Window**  | Time-bound opportunity | "Tax deadline approaching"             |
| **Early Access**     | Genuine advantage      | "First cohort helps shape the program" |

**Never**:

- Fake countdown timers
- Manufactured scarcity
- "Limited time" that resets

#### Step 14: P.S.

P.S. = Second headline. Readers skip to end.

**Uses**:

- Summarize main benefit
- Restate guarantee
- Add real reason to act (if applicable)
- Introduce bonus

### Phase 3: Refinement (Steps 15-28)

15. **Checklist**: Verify all techniques included
16. **Graphic Enhancement**: Bullets, bold, callouts
17. **Pretest**: Read aloud, show to customers, clarity test
    18-28. **Rewrite → Layout → Mock-Up → Cool-Off → Opinions → Final Review → Print → Send**

**Secret of Sequences**: Multi-step always beats single shot.

## Sugarman 23 Copy Elements

**Axiom**: Copy = Slippery Slide. Every sentence exists to get the next sentence read.

### Core Principle

Sentence n gets sentence n+1. First sentence pulls reader in. Momentum builds. Reader slides down like child on playground slide. Cannot stop until bottom (decision point).

**Derivation**: Earned Entry — each sentence earns the right to the next.

### The 23 Elements

| #   | Element                   | Purpose         | Application                     |

| 1   | **Typeface**              | Readability     | Serif for body (comprehension)  |
| 2   | **First Sentence**        | Entry point     | Short, simple, compelling       |
| 3   | **Second Sentence**       | Momentum        | Continue the pull               |
| 4   | **Paragraph Headings**    | Scanners        | Break text, tease sections      |
| 5   | **Product Explanation**   | Clarity         | Match complexity to product     |
| 6   | **New Features**          | Differentiation | Highlight what's unique         |
| 7   | **Technical Explanation** | Credibility     | Include even if unread          |
| 8   | **Anticipate Objections** | Preemption      | Raise before reader thinks      |
| 9   | **Resolve Objections**    | Proof           | Answer with evidence            |
| 10  | **Gender**                | Targeting       | Tailor language to audience     |
| 11  | **Clarity**               | Understanding   | No jargon, no clichés           |
| 12  | **Rhythm**                | Flow            | Vary sentence lengths           |
| 13  | **Service**               | Confidence      | Address repairs, support        |
| 14  | **Physical Dimensions**   | Concreteness    | Always include specs            |
| 15  | **Trial Period**          | Risk reversal   | Longer = fewer returns          |
| 16  | **Price Comparison**      | Value framing   | Compare to relevant alternative |

| 19  | **Offer Summary**         | Clarity         | What they get for money         |
| 20  | **Avoid Too Much**        | Focus           | Ruthless editing                |
| 21  | **Ease of Ordering**      | Friction        | Clear process                   |

## Hypnotic Writing (Vitale 5-Step)

**Axiom**: Hypnosis = Focused Attention. Waking trance through stories.

Not manipulation. Does not remove choice.

### 5-Step Process

| Step | Name          | Action                                |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Intention** | Clear outcome in mind                 |
| 2    | **Research**  | Immerse in product, customers, market |
| 3    | **Creation**  | Free flow (no critic, get words out)  |
| 4    | **Rewrite**   | Sharpen (cut heads and feet)          |
| 5    | **Test**      | Marketplace feedback, split tests     |

### Story Power

Stories bypass defenses:

- Unresolved hook (open loop → paid back)
- TPM: Transformational Philosophical Message
- Connotation > Denotation (implied emotional)

**Derivation**: Pregnant Void — what's withheld in story creates forward motion; payback protects trust.

1. Act, don't gripe
2. Break rules deliberately
3. Change habits regularly
4. Build resilience to rejection
5. Explore uncomfortable edges
6. Maintain focus on outcome
