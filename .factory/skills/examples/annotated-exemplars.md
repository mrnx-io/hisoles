## Exemplar 1: Landing Page Hero + Offer Section (Service)

### Hero

**Stop rewriting your homepage.**

Write one promise people can believe.
Then prove it.
Then ask.

**[NOTE: Rule of One. Earned Entry. Short lines = Ma.]**

If your page lists five outcomes, visitors do what humans do under uncertainty:

They hesitate.
They leave.

**[NOTE: Problem naming without doom. Earned Entry + Living Materials.]**

### What this is

**Copy Diagnosis (30 minutes).**

You bring your page.
We find the one promise that should lead.
We rewrite the top section together.

**[NOTE: Clarity anchor. No mystique. Sacred Friction: "bring your page."]**

### What you leave with

- a headline + subhead built on one idea
- three bullets that match one emotion
- the one objection your page must answer
- a clean CTA that doesn't feel like pressure

**[NOTE: Concrete deliverables. Earned Entry.]**

### Who this is for

This is for you if:

- you have a real offer
- you already have traffic (even a little)
- you want clarity more than cleverness

This is not for you if:

- you want "viral copy"
- you want guaranteed results without effort
- you're still deciding what you sell

**[NOTE: Sacred Friction + fit filter. Protects refunds.]**

### The cost (honest)

You'll need to show up prepared.
You'll need to choose one idea and let the others go.

If you don't want that constraint, don't book.

**[NOTE: Sacred Friction stated explicitly. Agency protected.]**

### The crossing

If you want the session, pick a time.

If you're not ready, don't force it.
Keep your money. Keep your dignity.

**[NOTE: Threshold ritual: stillness, summary, cost, agency, step.]**

## Exemplar 2: Email (Story Lead) with Open Loop Ledger

**Subject:** The day I stopped "adding benefits"

Hey—

I used to think better copy meant more.

More benefits.
More proof.
More bullets.

**[NOTE: Ma. Simple sentences. Earned Entry.]**

Then I watched someone read a page I wrote.

They weren't reading.
They were hunting.

Scrolling.
Skipping.
Looking for one thing to hold.

**[NOTE: Yūgen through selective detail. Clarity anchor remains.]**

That's when I realized:

When a page promises five outcomes, the reader believes none.

Not because they're cynical.
Because they're human.

**[NOTE: Living Materials: stable human pattern. No insult.]**

Here's the constraint that fixed my pages:

**One promise. One proof path. One ask.**

Tomorrow I'll send you the worksheet I use to find the one promise.

For now, try this:

If you had to delete every benefit but one—
which one would you keep?

—[NAME]

P.S. Tomorrow's worksheet takes 10 minutes. It's uncomfortable in the good way.

**[NOTE: Open loop ledger]**

- Loop opened: "the worksheet"
- Payback: "Tomorrow I'll send…"
- Repayment: tool that reduces effort and increases clarity

## Exemplar 3: Ad (Problem–Solution) Without False Urgency

**Your offer isn't too expensive.**

Your page is too unclear.

**[NOTE: Proclamation lead, but calm. Earned Entry.]**

If people can't find one promise to believe, price feels risky.

So they leave.
Not because they hate you—
because uncertainty is expensive.

**[NOTE: Living Materials. No blame.]**

Get the 1‑page "Rule of One" worksheet.

It helps you:

- choose the one outcome to lead with
- write proof bullets that match that outcome
- place a CTA that feels clean

Free download.

**[NOTE: Offer disclosed. No hidden terms. No fake urgency.]**
