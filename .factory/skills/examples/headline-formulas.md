## Truth Gate Check for Headlines

Before using any headline:

1. **Specificity**: Is the claim falsifiable?
2. **Evidence**: Can I prove this?
3. **Worst-case**: What's the least favorable interpretation?
4. **Post-purchase**: Would I still stand by it after they buy?

If any answer is "no," revise the headline.

## Testing Protocol

1. Write 5-10 headline variations using different formulas
2. Test LF8 appeals: which desire resonates most?
3. A/B split test top 2 performers
4. Winner becomes control; test against it
5. Document what works for this audience
