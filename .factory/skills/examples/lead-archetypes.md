I understand because I once sent a proposal with "their" instead
of "there" to a Fortune 500 CEO. I didn't get the contract.

that eliminates the 20 mistakes that undermine your professionalism.

According to a Fidelity study, the average American spends 10+ hours
researching a vacation—but less than 2 hours reviewing their retirement plan
each year.

If you're over 40, this planning gap could mean the difference between
retiring comfortably and working longer than you'd like.

The good news: There's a simple annual review process that takes 60 minutes
and covers the 7 factors that matter most.

Financial planners have used this framework for decades. Now you can too.

[HINT AT ANSWER / TRANSITION TO CONTENT]
```

### Full Example

```
On a beautiful late spring afternoon, twenty-five years ago, two young
men graduated from the same college.

They were very much alike, these two young men. Both had been better
than average students, both were personable and both—as young college
graduates are—were filled with ambitious dreams for the future.

Recently, these two men returned to college for their 25th reunion.

They were still very much alike. Both were happily married. Both had
three children. And both, it turned out, had gone to work for the same
Midwestern manufacturing company after graduation, and were still there.

But there was a difference. One of the men was manager of a small
department of that company. The other was its president.

What Made The Difference?

Have you ever wondered, as I have, what makes this kind of difference
in people's lives?

It isn't always native intelligence, or talent, or dedication. It isn't
that one person wants success and the other doesn't.

The difference lies in what each person knows—and how they use that
knowledge.

That's why I'm writing to you about The Wall Street Journal...
