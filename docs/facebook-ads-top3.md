## Variant 1: "The Moment It Hits"

### Primary Text

There's a moment in every shift.

You know the one.

Hour 5, hour 6... you feel it coming. That dull ache spreads from your heels to your arches. Your feet go from "tired" to "screaming."

By the time you clock out, you're limping to your car. Barely making it to the couch.

If you've ever said "my feet are killing me" halfway through your shift... this is for you.

Hisoles are engineered insoles built for people who stand all day on hard floors. Nurses. Warehouse workers. Retail. Kitchen staff. Construction.

Not squishy foam that "mushes out" by lunch.

A structural frame that holds your arch in place — shift after shift.

→ $69 for 2 pairs (most people rotate between work shoes and everything else)
→ $39 to try 1 pair
→ 90-day guarantee. Test them on real shifts. Full refund if they don't earn their place.

## Variant 2: "The Insole Graveyard"

### Primary Text

I've got a drawer full of dead gel insoles.

Dr. Scholl's. Walmart brand. Those "memory foam" ones that forgot everything after a week.

They all felt amazing... for about 4 shifts. Then they went flat. And my feet were right back to hurting by hour 6.

Here's what nobody tells you about gel insoles: they're designed to compress. That's literally how they work. Gel absorbs impact by squishing down. Problem is, it never unsquishes.

So you're basically paying $15 every few weeks to stand on pancakes.

I switched to Hisoles 3 months ago. Different engineering entirely. There's a structural frame inside that holds your arch in place — not gel, not foam. Actual architecture.

Week 1 felt good. Week 12 feels the same.

My only regret is the money I wasted on that insole graveyard first.

## Variant 3: "The Walk to the Parking Lot"

### Primary Text

The walk from the floor to the parking lot shouldn't feel like this.

Limping.
Shuffling.
Counting the steps until you can sit down.

You've been on your feet for 10, 12 hours. Concrete. Tile. Hard floors that don't give.

Your foam insoles gave up around hour 6. Now you're running on willpower.

Here's the thing nobody tells you:

Foam compresses. It flattens out. That "cushion" you felt on day one? Gone by week two.

Hisoles are different.

Structured support from a frame — not just foam. A heel cup that grounds your landings. Quiet cushion that doesn't bottom out.

Try them for 90 days on real shifts. If they don't work, send them back. Full refund.

→ 2 pairs for $69 (rotate between shoes)
→ 1 pair for $39 to test

Your feet carried you through another shift. Return the favor.
