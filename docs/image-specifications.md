**Filename:** `hero-lifestyle.webp`  
**Dimensions:** 2048x2048px (square, mobile-first)  
**Format:** WebP, quality 85

### Concept: "End-of-Shift Relief"

**Scene:** Worker arriving home after a long shift, visible relief on face/body language.

**Primary Shot Options (choose one):**

| Option                   | Description                                                                                                   | Why it converts                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A: Doorway Moment**    | Worker (scrubs/uniform visible) stepping through front door, shoes coming off, insoles visible on top of shoe | Instantly communicates "I stand all day" + shows product in context |
| **B: Break Room Exhale** | Worker seated, work shoes beside them, insoles half-visible, relaxed posture                                  | Captures the "finally off my feet" feeling                          |
| **C: Kitchen Counter**   | Casual home setting, work shoes on mat near door, insoles visible, person in background (blur)                | Lifestyle context without requiring model release for face          |

### Technical Requirements

- **Lighting:** Warm, natural light (golden hour or soft indoor)
- **Color palette:** Must harmonize with washi (#FCFAF5) background
- **Product visibility:** Insoles should be visible but secondary to the human moment
- **Composition:** Rule of thirds, product in lower third for text overlay space
- **Mood:** Relief, calm, end-of-day exhale (NOT medical/clinical)

### Model/Talent Notes

- Age range: 28-50
- Visible fatigue that reads as "hard day at work" not "exhausted/unhealthy"
- Uniform elements that signal profession without being too specific:
  - Scrubs (healthcare)
  - Steel-toe boots + hi-vis vest (construction/warehouse)
  - Non-slip shoes + apron (hospitality)

### DO NOT

- Medical/clinical settings (too sterile)
- Posed product-in-hand shots (feels like an ad)
- Extreme close-ups of feet (off-putting)
- Smiling directly at camera (feels inauthentic)
