## 1. Hero Lifestyle Image

**File:** `hero-lifestyle.webp`  
**Size:** 2048x2048px (square)

> A warm, golden-hour photograph of a tired but relieved healthcare worker (wearing scrubs) stepping through their front door after a long shift. Work shoes visible near the door with insoles resting on top. Soft natural lighting, residential interior, cozy and calm mood. The person shows subtle relief in body language — not posing, just arriving home. Shot at eye level, shallow depth of field on the shoes/insoles. Color palette harmonizes with warm cream tones.

## 2. Product Hero Shot

**File:** `hero.webp`  
**Size:** 1600x1600px (square)

> Clean product photography of a single pair of premium comfort insoles on a minimal cream/off-white background. 3/4 angle showing arch support structure and heel cup depth. Soft directional lighting from upper left creating subtle shadows. The insole should look engineered and substantial, not flimsy. Focus on material texture and structural details.

---

## 3. Bundle Shot

**File:** `bundles.webp`  
**Size:** 1600x1100px

> Two packaged pairs of premium insoles arranged in minimal branded packaging on a cream background. Slight overlap to show "2-pack" concept. Clean, e-commerce style product photography. One package slightly open to reveal the insole inside. Soft shadows, bright and airy feel.

## 4. Mechanism: Arch Cross-Section

**File:** `mechanism-arch-cutaway.webp`  
**Size:** 800x600px

> Clean cross-section cutaway of an insole at the arch/midfoot area, showing three distinct layers: thin fabric top cover, foam cushion middle layer, and structural support frame at the bottom (highlighted in orange/persimmon accent color). Photoreal render style on white gradient background. Sharp edge detail on cut line, material textures visible. Minimal, modern, technical aesthetic.

---

## 5. Mechanism: Heel Cup

**File:** `mechanism-heel-cup.webp`  
**Size:** 800x600px

> Rear 45-degree angle view of an insole showing the deep heel cup structure. The heel cup walls should appear substantial and cradling. Subtle orange/persimmon accent highlighting the cup edge. Clean white/gray gradient background. Soft shadow showing depth. Simple line overlay indicating where the heel would sit.

---

## 6. Mechanism: Foam vs Frame Comparison

**File:** `mechanism-packdown-comparison.webp`  
**Size:** 1200x600px

> Split-screen comparison image. Left side: flattened, compressed foam insole (gray tones, "sad" appearance, labeled "Hour 10: Foam-only"). Right side: maintained arch shape insole with structural frame (orange/persimmon accent, confident appearance, labeled "Hour 10: Frame-First"). Clean diagrammatic style, not overly realistic. Clear visual contrast between compression and maintained structure.

**Size:** 200x200px
